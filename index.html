            <h2>Welcome Home!</h2>
            <p>Making Jesus Christ known both in our community and around the globe while equipping the
                saints for Christian service is the driving force of all that we do at Freedom Road Bible Church. We
                offer several areas of ministry geared toward all age groups. We invite you and your family to come and
                worship the Lord Jesus Christ with our family. We promise that you'll feel right at home!</p>
            <p>Visiting any church for the very first time can be a difficult experience. We don’t ever want that to be
                the case at Freedom Road. Your first visit to FRBC will be uplifting, friendly, and enjoyable for your
                entire family. Come and experience worshipful praise, biblical teaching, expository preaching, friendly
                people, and a place where you feel welcome!</p>
            <p>Our campus is located at 850 State Route 52. The main entrance is right in front of the church, and
                you'll recognize it by the large wood doors. There are greeters that will meet you, answer any
                questions you may have, and give directions. Adults and teens attend the Worship Service where
                they enjoy the beautiful and worshipful music, and a clear, helpful, and challenging verse-by-verse
                Bible message from Pastor Rick, while children ages 3-10 participate in our Children’s Church service
                in the lower level. The service is a little over one hour in length.</p>
            <p>There is also Sunday School for all ages the hour before the main service at 9:15am. These classes are a
                smaller group setting where you are invited to meet people, enjoy some coffee and a doughnut, and
                engage in a Bible lesson that is more directly applicable to each life-stage. One of the best ways to
                get to know people at Freedom Road is to come to a Bible Study! We also offer a qualified, well-trained
                nursery for both Sunday School and our Worship Service.</p>
