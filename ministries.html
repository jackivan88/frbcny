            <h2 id="childrens-church">Children’s Church</h2>
            <p>Children’s Church happens on Sunday mornings in the classrooms downstairs during the Morning Worship Service. Children are taught the Bible biographies that comprise the Old and New Testaments in a fashion that is accessible to them, in the hopes of preparing them for participation in the service upstairs when they are older. Children’s Church serves children from three years of age to ten years of age.</p>

            <h2 id="free-indeed">Free Indeed</h2>
            <p>Led by Tracy Bruschi and taking its name from John 8:36, this ministry meets each Tuesday from 6:30-7:30pm here at FRBC. Ladies, don’t be satisfied with being on the “outside looking in” come and grow with us! It is here that you can learn how to serve and be an integral part of the family of God at FRBC!</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/FRBCFreeIndeed">Keep up to date and connect with us on Facebook!</a></p>
            <h2 id="greeter-ministry">Greeter Ministry</h2>
            <p>The FRBC Greeters Ministry exists to welcome and greet with a spirit of genuine love, sincerity, and concern for all who enter the doors of Freedom Road…every visitor, guest, and member. Our goal is to set a friendly and warm atmosphere of love, joy, comfort, and enthusiasm for worshipping our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Because Greeters are the first point of contact, we strive to make a great first impression of our Lord, our Pastor and FRBC. We are committed to making sure our visitors and guests needs are met by familiarizing them with our church facilities and what our church has to offer as it relates to our Mission, Vision, Values, Beliefs, Stewardship, and Ministries.</p>

            <h2 id="mens-ministry">Men’s Ministry</h2>
            <p>The Men’s Ministry at FRBC seeks to glorify and serve God through the building of character, integrity and influence by encouraging men to take the next step in walking with Christ through prayer, study, fellowship and reproducing His Life in the lives of others. We currently meet once a month for a “Guy’s Night Out” where we share a meal and testimonies and also annually for our “Camping Retreat”. Check out these events below for all the details!</p>
            <p>This ministry meets each Tuesday from 6:30-7:30pm here at FRBC and is designed specifically for men. Come and grow together with other men into the servant-leaders that God has designed for us to be. It is here that you can learn how to serve and be an integral part of the family of God at FRBC!</p>
            <p>At least once each year, we get apart from the “hustle and bustle” to both study the Word of God and grow with each other. The Men’s Camping Retreat is the highlight of our Men’s Ministry each year!</p>
            <h2 id="nursery">Nursery</h2>
            <p>Our Nursery Ministry is available each Sunday Morning. Featuring a loving environment for your infant ages birth - 2 years, our nursery is staffed with trained, experienced workers. While you attend our Worship Service, children here will play, sing, hear Bible stories, create crafts, watch videos and enjoy a snack (age appropriate). It is our goal to create and maintain a safe, clean and loving place for our members and visitors to bring their children.</p>

            <h2 id="olympians">Olympians</h2>
            <p>The FRBC Olympians Program is built on a powerful goal: to lay a solid foundation of biblical principles at a young age in the lives of children. We want to teach them from the very start the important fundamentals of spiritual growth. The Olympian ministry is built on an important theme in Scripture; the olympic athlete. Paul uses this illustration often saying that he wanted to “finish the race.”</p>
            <p>The Olympian program is broken down into 4 different age groups. Ages 4-5 are called the Gophers, Grades 1-2 are called Challengers, Grades 3-4 are called Conquerors, and Grades 5-6 are called Champions. Every component of our ministry program is tailored to the developmental level of the appropriate grades. In Small Group time, Quiet Time, Scripture Memory, and Christian Service each level gets more challenging, yet remains age-appropriate.</p>
            <p>From year to year our goal is to help students move forward as spiritual athletes in the great race of the Christian life.</p>
            <h3 id="new-time-for-2018-19">New Time for 2018-19</h3>
            <p>We meet each Friday (September - May) at 6:00pm. Come out and join us! You can review the curriculum <a href="https://lcm.wol.org/curriculum/olympian/">here</a> and download a registration form <a href="forms/olympians-registration-2018-2019.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="soccer-camp">Soccer Camp</h2>
            <p>FRBC Soccer Camp is a summer soccer camp for kids from age 5 to grade 6. It’s for athletes and non-athletes; for those who know soccer inside-out, and for those who have never touched a soccer ball - kids at any and every skill level will benefit!</p>
            <p>Kids will learn basic soccer skills, get lots of exercise and enjoy singing, skits and Bible teaching - all based on a new and exciting theme each year!</p>

            <h2 id="the-clean-team">The Clean Team</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the Cleaning Ministry is to come to church once a week and pick up after services and keep our church well maintained so visitors have a pleasant experience. Colossians 3:17 says, “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.” Even in something as “unglamorous” as cleaning the church we bring God glory if we are doing it in his name!</p>
            <p>There are always opportunities with “The Clean Team” and we are always looking to grow. Would you like to join us? Email us and let us know!</p>
            <p><a href="">Download the Cleaning Schedule</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="usher-ministry">Usher Ministry</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the Ushers Ministry at FRBC is not merely to serve people, as in a theater or restaurant. Our purpose is to serve God. Ensuring that an atmosphere of reverence and order is maintained before, during, and after the service, assisting worshippers to their seats, handing out bulletins and gathering the offerings, we do it all to serve Jesus Christ. All that we do as ushers is not “as unto men, but unto God”.</p>

            <h2 id="worship-ministry">Worship Ministry</h2>
            <p>At FRBC, we believe that praise and worship are an active, dynamic, integral link between God and His people. This ministry seeks to serve Him humbly in a spirit of excellence through music and to lead others into His presence so that we glorify God as one Body with one voice through one Spirit. We gather together for rehearsal each Friday evening at 8:30pm. Opportunities to be a part of this ministry are available for those gifted with musical ability who have the desire to serve.</p>
            <h2 id="youth-group">Youth Group</h2>
            <p>The FRBC Youth Group establishes students grades 7-12 as lifelong disciples through a deep study of God’s Word, mobilizing them to live with a godly perspective and evident faith. With an energetic look at biblically based content, life application and an emphasis on both Scripture memory and outreach, students are truly encouraged to become the champions for Christ that God has designed us to be!</p>
