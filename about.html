            <ul>
                <li>God's Word, both the Old and New Testament, to be fully inspired by God and without error. As the
                    written record of His supernatural revelation of Himself to man, the Bible is the final authority
                    for every Christian's faith and practice.</li>
                <li>In only one God who is the Creator of all things, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, existing in
                    three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These three persons are the same in substance and
                    equal in power and glory.</li>
                <li>That Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man, conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin
                    Mary.</li>
                <li>That man was created in the image of God; that he sinned in Adam, and is therefore alienated from
                    God and is spiritually dead. It is only through regeneration that eternal and spiritual life can be
                    obtained.</li>
                <li>The shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection are the only means by which a person can be
                    justified, obtain eternal life and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</li>
                <li>That salvation is a free gift and is by grace alone, apart from human merit.</li>
                <li>That all believers should be baptized by immersion as the first step of obedience to Christ.</li>
                <li>That there are only two ordinance for the New Testament church spoken of in Scripture: baptism and
                    the Lord's Supper (communion).</li>
                <li>In the imminent return of our Lord Jesus Christ and that He will come back to earth the second time
                    personally, bodily, and visibly.</li>
                <li>In the bodily resurrection of the dead, and the eternal existence of all mankind in either Heaven
                    or Hell which includes divine judgments, rewards, and punishments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We understand that there are many practices and doctrines that are considered &quot;orthodox&quot; which
                do not contradict Scripture, but which are not directly addressed in His Word. We are committed to
                giving liberty in the belief and practice of these teachings, but we will endeavor to maintain the
                simplicity of the Biblical testimony and stated practices as we are given grace to perceive them. We do
                not accept any spiritual experience as having its source in the Holy Spirit that does not have a
                precedent in Scripture. We do not accept as truth any revelation, vision, dream, prophecy or
                discernment which contradicts Scripture, or cannot be verified by it. We do not believe that any other
                writings have the same authority as the divinely inspired and preserved canon of Scripture.</p>
            <h2 id="history">History</h2>
            <p>In 1991, God placed a vision in the heart and mind of six small families to reach the Hudson Valley for
                Christ. Under the direction of the Holy Spirit and the leadership of Pastor Rick Bruschi, Sr., Freedom
                Road Bible Church began as a small home Bible of six families which quickly outgrew the home and had to
                meet in a local hotel conference room. After outgrowing the conference room, FRBC met at Chapel Field
                Christian High School in Pine Bush, NY for the next four years.</p>
            <p>In 1995, with less than one hundred members, God placed it upon our hearts to build a facility where the
                Gospel could be proclaimed without ceasing. God blessed FRBC with three acres of land on Route 52 in
                Walden, NY. Over the next year God blessed with an 1800 square foot building with a fellowship hall on
                the main level. Almost immediately the fellowship hall needed to be converted to classrooms to
                accommodate the emerging and growing ministry and outreach areas. FRBC continued to reach the lost for
                Christ and train the believers over the next several years.</p>
            <p>November 19, 2003 began a very difficult time for FRBC as our Pastor, Rick Sr., went home to be with his
                Lord and Savior. Having served as Associate Pastor with his father since 2001, Rick Bruschi II was
                called to carry the mantle as Pastor of Freedom Road in January of 2004. Today Pastor Rick and Tracy,
                under the direction of the Holy Spirit, and with the assistance of godly deacons and trustees lead
                Freedom Road Bible Church in continuing to be a growing, vibrant, loving, faithful example to the world
                of what a New Testament church should be. We invite you to come and worship with us as we continue to
                endeavor to REACH, TEACH, and LEAD others, so that NONE would be lost!</p>
